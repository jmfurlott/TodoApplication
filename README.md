# TODO Application

Tutorial app made for Codepath that allows the user to create, edit and delete items in a todo list.

## Usage

## Changes

While the prework asked for a second Activity to be created, I went ahead and just made editing available via a single click in a Dialog.  Having another Activity felt like overkill so I opted for the simpler solution.  

The long press to delete was also removed as this seems against the Android guidelines especially with Android M's Google Now longpress update. (TODO)

## TODO

- [ ] Add a delete icon instead of a long press. (Add an "are you sure")
- [ ] Multiple lists? ViewPager? Nav drawer? A FAB could handle new lists?
- [x] Clear all in the menu
- [ ] Put write/read items in an async task
